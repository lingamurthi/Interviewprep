input tag within form tag we need to add name attribute

intercept property changes during class and template interaction we have two approaches one is split two way binding syntax and other is getters or setters

intercept changes during parent to child has two getters and setters and anpther one is ngonchanges


if input is only one value then getters and settes is better
if input is array of values then ngonchanges is better 
ngonchanges works only for the child component
