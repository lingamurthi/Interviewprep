react.strictmode  ----  intentionally double invoke of functional component body only on development mode


after initial render if we call setter function but set the state to same value component will not rerender



after component rerender if u set the state to the same value but component will rerender one more time

if the state is primitive type if it is new string, number or boolean if it not the case react beal out render phase


comparsion made b/w previous state and current state react uses Object.is algorithm





when we push element to same array , array elements change but array reference will not change (component will not render) to fix this we need to do copy the array



Parent component render child component will also render
